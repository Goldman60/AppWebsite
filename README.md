Submission guidelines
=====================
* All submissions to this repo must follow the general style of the code
  (no strict style guidelines are enforced)
* All commits *must* be signed by a [Github recognized PGP key](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-using-gpg/) 
  (I like the verified check box and the traceability)

Build Requirements
==================
* PHP 7.1
* [Any required Symfony setup](https://symfony.com/doc/3.1.5/setup.html)
* At the moment there are some special symlinks required, I will eliminate
  those before its pushed to bleeding, this currently breaks Bootstrap see
